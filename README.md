Techocrat
=========
Technocrat is an ambient techno machine based upon the principle that everything should arpeggiate upwards.  It moves gradually between crisp melodies, twinkling drones, and fuzzy noise.

Technocrat uses [Audiolet](https://www.github.com/oampo/Audiolet) to generate and schedule the sounds, and [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/) to create the UI.
